Building Corgicoin
==================

IMPORTANT: Before building, please read MODERNIZATION.md for critical security
information about outdated dependencies and recommended versions.

Quick Start
-----------

For GUI wallet (Corgicoin-QT):
    See doc/readme-qt.rst for detailed build instructions

For daemon (corgicoind):
    See doc/build-unix.txt (Linux/Unix)
    See doc/build-osx.txt (macOS)
    See doc/build-msw.txt (Windows)

Modernization Status
--------------------

This codebase (v1.4.1.6) has been modernized with C++11 support but still
requires dependency upgrades for production use. See MODERNIZATION.md for:
- Critical security warnings (OpenSSL 1.0.x vulnerabilities)
- Recommended modern dependency versions
- Build configuration updates
- Testing requirements

Recommended Dependencies for Modern Systems
-------------------------------------------

- OpenSSL 3.x (CRITICAL - 1.0.x has known vulnerabilities)
- Boost 1.70+ (for C++11/14/17 compatibility)
- Berkeley DB 5.3.28+ or 6.x (for wallet storage)
- Qt 5.15 LTS (for GUI builds)
- GCC 7+ or Clang 7+ (C++11 support required)

See MODERNIZATION.md for complete dependency information and migration guide.
